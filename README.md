# fox

A Slim framework 3 bootstrap that is very foxy indeed.

## Slim Console

Available Commands:
* `php slim app:test` : A simple Test Command
* `php slilm migration:create` : Create a new Database Migration
* `php slim migration:migrate` : Run the migrations


## Migrations

Please ensure that you configure the migrations properly, the config file can be found `phinx.yml` - which will allow you to configure migrations dependent on your development environment
