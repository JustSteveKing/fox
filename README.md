# fox

A Slim framework 3 bootstrap that is very foxy indeed.

## Slim Console

Available Commands:
* `php slim app:test` : A simple Test Command
* `php slilm migration:create` : Create a new Database Migration
* `php slim migration:migrate` : Run the migrations
* `php slim migration:reset` : Reset all Migrations
* `php slim migration:rollback` : Rollback previous Migration


## Migrations

Migrations are configured in `phinx.php` instead of the default `phinx.yml` to allow us to pull bootstrap configuration from our application.
